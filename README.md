# BookList
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing App which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic.
It allows user to enter a keyword, press the search button, and recieve a list of published books which relate to that keyword.
To achieve this, Google Books API is used in order to fetch results and display them to the user. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.
